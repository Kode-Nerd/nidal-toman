      No matter how small the procedure and how careful your doctor has been -
      every major medical treatment carries a risk of subsequent complications
      such as secondary bleeding or wound healing disorders. However, you
      usually have to pay for any follow-up treatments outside of your health
      insuranceâ€™s range of services, such as cosmetic surgery or dental
      implantation. medassure assumes these costs. So that you can concentrate
      fully on your healing, you should secure a non-medically necessary
      treatment in advance.
