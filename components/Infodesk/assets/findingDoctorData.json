Nothing is better than a personal\nrecommendation, but here too you can be lucky or unlucky. \n Sources of information such as the Internet or forums are very helpful when searching. However, there are always some points to consider. \n Is the doctor you came across through your search a specialist in plastic & aesthetic surgery? \nOr just a surgeon or an ear, nose and throat doctor? Make at least 2 consultation appointments!"

    "subtitle": "After the interview, you should have the impression that you know everything you need to know. Now you have to decide. Don't let yourself be put under pressure! All aesthetic interventions can be planned in peace. Statements such as: 'We can only operate on you this week or if you come tomorrow it is particularly cheap' should make you think. Basically: a serious doctor will never have a problem if you want to get a second medical opinion before making your final decision. \n\n If you decide now, trust your feelings. If there is something you don't like, keep looking. You will find the right doctor for you.\n\nPrice differences should not significantly influence your decision. Not everything that is particularly cheap or expensive is also good."
