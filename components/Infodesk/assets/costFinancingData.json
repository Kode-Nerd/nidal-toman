    "subtitle": "The costs vary depending on the patient's findings. Therefore, an exact calculation can only be made by the surgeon after a personal interview. It is therefore possible that you will receive relatively precise information about the expected total costs (the procedure, the anesthetist, the hospital, the follow-up treatment) of your plastic-aesthetic procedure during your first consultation. So that you are not surprised by unexpected payments afterwards, you will receive a cost estimate following the consultation, which will inform you in detail about the expenses planned for the operation. As a rule, the final amount after the operation hardly ever deviates from the cost estimate."
