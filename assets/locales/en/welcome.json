  "philosophy": "Plastic surgery is like medicine meets art. Like an artist, I take immense pleasure in both the process and the result. But as a medical doctor, the purely artistic aspect is not my only interest. Rather, my philosophy is to maintain the perfect balance between beauty and well-being, to create a lasting harmony of health and beauty, and to offer my clients a way to achieve their true selves.",
