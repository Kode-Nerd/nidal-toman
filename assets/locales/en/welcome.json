  "philosophy": "Plastic surgery is where medicine meets art. As an artist, I take immense pleasure in both the process and the result. Yet, as a medical doctor, the purely artistic aspect, alone, is not my only interest. I rather aim to create a lasting harmony of health and beauty. That's why my philosophy is based on maintaining the perfect balance between beauty and well-beingâ€” to give my clients a way to reach their true selves while looking and feeling better.",
