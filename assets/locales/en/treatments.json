        "content": "The natural ageing process inevitably leads to reduced skin elasticity—with various intensity of wrinkling.\nThe facelift is certainly the most invasive but also the most effective method of achieving visual rejuvenation by rejuvenating the entire face or neck region. The anatomical characteristics that determine our facial expression require special surgical techniques. Essentially, the procedure involves shifting skin flaps with incisions in the hairline area and around the ear. The so-called large face-lift includes a tightening of all structures, i.e. skin and superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS). The SMAS consists of a layer of degenerated muscles with connective tissue and extends from the temples to the neck."

        "content": "An effective facelift procedure starts with detaching the skin of the temple area, cheeks, and the lateral neck region from the underlying SMAS (superficial musculoaponeurotic system) layer while avoiding injury to the facial nerves. Then, the skin is brought under slight tension to the side above and sutured, after removing the excess. Meanwhile, the SMAS  is fixed to support the tightening. Volume adjustments can additionally be made using the patient's fat in the face, e.g. to slightly emphasise the cheekbone region (cheek augmentation). With this kind of double-layer lift, the durability of ten to fifteen years can be achieved.\nWhen weighing up the surgical procedure, between the mini-lift (also called S-lift) and the large lift, the age of the patient should, of course, be taken into consideration.\nIn my experience, younger patients only need a skin tightening, as there is generally no slackening of tissue or muscles. Through a well-positioned incision, the scars can remain invisible. The effect of such procedure only lasts for about 4-5 years, since the deep-lying supporting tissue remains untouched. Despite the critical discussion, the mini-lift is used very often because this technique is more comfortable for the patient and the recovery phase is considerably shorter.\nThe lower cheek and the neck areas are the parts of the face, which are particularly critical for women in their mid-forties and older. Thus, as part of the big lift, the neck is usually tightened in combination with the cheeks. It may also make sense to perform an isolated neck lift. For instances when patients complain of loose skin on the neck, hanging necks, or turkey necks. The supporting tissue can be tightened from a small incision below the chin, if necessary in combination with liposuction. For this procedure, the skin should still have enough elasticity to adapt to the neck without wrinkling after liposuction.\nThe large facelift is often combined with a forehead lift if the forehead and eyebrow area also need to be lifted. The classic forehead lift is performed through a coronary incision in a bow-shaped incision from ear to ear in the hairy area of the head. During this procedure, the skin in the entire forehead area, possibly up to the eyebrow line, is mobilised, tightened and the excess skin is removed. After the forehead lift, a fine, barely visible scar remains behind the hairline. In the case of a conspicuously high forehead, a pre hairline cut can be used since the other incision techniques would result in a higher forehead. The disadvantage of this procedure is a possibly visible scar directly in front of the hairline.\nMuch more elegant, however, a forehead lift can be performed using the most modern techniques based on endoscopy. This minimally invasive technique has dramatically changed the plastic surgery approach over the last decade. Using newly developed devices and special instruments, our procedures can be performed safely and effectively with only minimal incisions and scars. A maximum of three to five mini incisions is made in the hairy scalp through which a tiny video camera and the endoscopic tube for the special instruments are inserted to detach and move the forehead skin. In this way, the forehead, temples and eyebrows can be lifted, transverse and longitudinal wrinkles on the forehead as well as smaller wrinkles in the eye area can be smoothed. The new position of the forehead is fixed with two small short screws in the outer skull bone, which are painlessly removed after about a week. The current surgical results are impressive and certainly, promise further applications in the future."

However, the hair will grow back over the next few months.\nBlood circulation disorders of the skin as a result of excessive nicotine consumption can lead to wound edge necrosis and conspicuous scars. That may require follow-up treatment. If bacterial infections appear, this can lead to wider scars due to delayed, secondary healing of the wound. That can be corrected by another minor operation. Damage to the facial nerves, which is almost impossible in expert hands, generally regenerates within 3 to 6 months. Occasionally, lesions of skin and muscle nerves may occur, but these regenerate on their own within weeks to months.

A harmonious-looking, aesthetic eye area is achieved through the interaction of many individual components. The shape and texture of the eyelids, eyelashes and eyebrows play a decisive role. Unfortunately, age-related changes in the face manifest themselves most clearly in this area.\nThe general \"downward trend\" is decisive for the impression of age, whereby not only a drooping, sagging upper eyelid, but also drooping eyelids or bags under the eyes make the eyes appear small and powerless, even if the mood is actually positive. With a cosmetic surgical intervention in this area, this impairing sagging of the skin can be removed relatively quickly and successfully."

In principle, eyelid lifting should only be carried out by an experienced surgeon, as subsequent corrections, for example in the case of ectropion formation (blepharoplasty), can lead to various complications. There are a number of possible surgical techniques available, whereby the choice of procedure depends on individual circumstances, the amount of skin and fatty tissue to be removed and, last but not least, the age of the patient. Depending on the procedure the surgery can be performed under local or general anaesthesia.\nThe remaining scar is no longer visible after healing, as it lies exactly in the crease of the upper eyelid that appears when the eye is open, and on the lower eyelid it runs directly along the lash line.\nAnother option for lower eyelid lifting is transconjunctival blepharoplasty. This elegant method has the advantage that no external skin incision is necessary if there is little excess skin and fat. The method via the conjunctiva is mainly favoured by younger patients, as only small amounts of fat usually have to be removed here."

In most cases, however, the patient, relatives and friends will hardly remember the original shape of the nose after a few weeks. Aesthetic correction of the nose is one of the most common procedures performed by plastic surgeons. The patient's ideas are always taken into account, and my experience in terms of type, shape, contour and what is technically possible is also taken into account. Together with you, the whole face and the whole profile must always be included in the operation plan. For example, a small nose can look too big - relatively speaking - because of a small chin. Balance can only be achieved here by simultaneously enlarging the chin. In cases where, in addition to a chin that is too small, there is also a misalignment of the jaw or teeth, consultation with an oral surgeon is referred to prior to rhinoplasty.

A crooked nose can be caused by displacement of the bone parts. In some patients, a second minor corrective operation to compensate for the internal scarring may be necessary after six months at the earliest.

This operation can also be performed later in life without any problems. Through a concealed incision behind the ear, the malformed cartilage at the edge of the ear is worked on in such a way that it can be fixed in the desired shape and the protruding ear can easily be placed in a natural position. To aid the healing process, a headband should be worn over the ears, especially at night, for 8 weeks."

If you have severe pain after the operation, this may indicate a bandage that is too tight or a haematoma. This must then be checked by the doctor. A haematoma can be punctured in most cases and only requires a second operation in exceptional cases. A temporary disturbance of the sensation of touch is normal and disappears by itself after some time. Very rarely, if the patient has a predisposition, a scar proliferation develops in the scar, a so-called keloid, which presents itself as a thick, bulging, discoloured, painful and itchy scar. Cortisone injections, pressure bandages and later surgical removal help here, but this is associated with the risk of the keloid recurring. In rare cases, infection of the wound or the ear cartilage can occur, which delays healing. Very rare is damage to the skin or cartilage due to disruption of the blood supply. The risk is increased if previous procedures have been performed on the outer ear. Usually, these areas heal spontaneously. Surgical coverage of the defect is rarely necessary. All surgical procedures require the severing of fine skin nerves, which can lead to reduced sensation or insensitivity, especially to cold. This slowly recedes over several months but can be persistent in individual cases. In the rare case of intolerance of the suture material, the suture is rejected, causing the auricle to protrude again. The cosmetic results after auricular correction are usually good. No two ears are alike, either before or after the operation. For example, one ear may be larger than the other and protrude further. The cartilage structure may also be different from the other. Even after the operation, the result can still change due to scarring or the restoring forces of the cartilage, so that a deformation of the auricle can occur again. A second surgical procedure can correct the results again in such cases."

A short period of immobilisation after the operation using plaster restraints is recommended in order to achieve an optimal, symmetrical result.\nThe same approach is chosen for chin reduction, whereby a harmonious profile contouring can be achieved here by simply removing the bone protrusion.

Mit der neuartigen, texturierten Oberfläche wird die Gefahr einer Kapselbildung mit z.T. schmerzhafter Verhärtung der Brust deutlich reduziert. Zur Auswahl stehen derzeit Füllsubstanzen wie Kochsalzlösung und Silikongel. Das in der Vergangenheit angebotene Sojaöl wurde wegen unerwünschter Nebenwirkungen 1999 vom Markt genommen. Hydrogel wurde im Dezember 2000 in Großbritannien ebenfalls zurückgezogen mangels Langzeitstudien, die einen unbedenklichen Einsatz belegen könnten.\nWelches Implantat letztlich zur Anwendung kommt, sollte der behandelnde Arzt im gemeinsamen Einvernehmen mit der Patientin entscheiden. Wir empfehlen unseren Patientinnen ausschließlich quervernetzte silikongelgefüllte Prothesen und verwenden hierbei nur die hochwertigsten und sichersten Markenprodukte. Durch eine überragende Vielzahl von Vorteilen, wie angenehme, weiche Konsistenz, gründliche medizinische Erforschung und hervorragende Stabilität hat sich dieser Einsatz über Jahrzehnte bewährt. Die Diskussionen in den Medien über Schädlichkeit des Silikons bzw.\nPlatzen der Implantate beim Tauchen oder im Flugzeug gehören endgültig der Vergangenheit an. Silicium als Bestandteil des Silikons ist das zweithäufigste Element der Erde und eines der am intensivsten erforschten Materialien in der Medizin. Es wurde umfangreichen Sicherheitstestes unterzogen und findet auch in der pharmazeutischen und lebensmittelverarbeitenden Industrie eine breite unbedenkliche Anwendung.\nDie Alternativen wie Kochsalzlösung oder Hydrogel sind flüssiger als Silikongel und daher unelastisch mit unbefriedigendem Tastempfinden bzw. durchgängig für die Implantathülle, so dass es im Gegensatz zu Silikongel zu unerwünschten Volumenschwankungen kommen kann.\nUnterschiedliche Formen werden angewandt. Es gibt runde, queroval und tropfenförmig anatomisch geformte Implantate, die entweder über oder unter dem Brustmuskel implantiert werden. Der Zugang kann von einem kleinen Schnitt in der Brustfalte, in der Achsel oder am Rand des Brustwarzenhofes erfolgen.\nMit welchem Verfahren das beste Ergebnis erzielt werden kann, hängt von der vorgegebenen Brustform, der Dicke des Brustdrüsengewebes und nicht zuletzt von den individuellen Wünschen der Patientin ab. Um eine optimale Brustform zu erreichen, kann eine zusätzliche Bruststraffung gelegentlich notwendig werden."

Im übrigen können die Implantate auch infolge von Brusttraumata, z. B. durch schwere Unfälle, verletzt werden und platzen. Die doppelwandige Umhüllung bietet hier weitgehend Schutz, dennoch kann es vorkommen, daß Füllmaterial in das umgebende Gewebe austritt. Bei Implantaten mit Kochsalzfüllung ist dies völlig harmlos, da Kochsalz innerhalb weniger Stunden völlig vom Körper resorbiert wird. Bei den anderen Füllmaterialien können durch Gewebereaktionen nach Monaten oder Jahren sogenannte Silikonome entstehen.\nUnabhängig von der Lage des Hautschnitts kann insbesondere bei großen Implantaten das Gefühl an der Brustwarze vorübergehend beeinträchtigt sein. In Ausnahmefällen kann es zu Wundheilungsstörungen, Blutergüssen, Infektionen und Serombildungen kommen, die dazu führen können, daß das Implantat vorübergehend entfernt werden muß.\nSind Sie als Frau in einem Alter, in dem Sie regelmäßig Mammographie-Untersuchungen vornehmen lassen, sollten Sie Ihren Arzt in jedem Fall über Ihr Brustimplantat informieren, da dieses die Untersuchungsergebnisse beeinträchtigen kann."

In den meisten Fällen ist eine gleichzeitige Korrektur der Lage und Größe der Brustwarzenhöfe erforderlich.\nDurch das Bewahren der Blutgefäße und Nerven an der Brustwarze ist das Gefühlsempfinden sowie die Stillfähigkeit im allgemeinen nicht eingeschränkt. Der Narbenverlauf bei der klassischen Standardmethode wird auch als ankerförmig oder umgekehrter T-Schnitt bezeichnet mit einer senkrechten und einer in der Brustfalte querverlaufenden Narbe. Je nach Brustgröße und Elastizität der Haut kann aber auch eine narbenarme Technik (nach Lejour) mit einer vertikalen Raffnaht zur Anwendung kommen, bei der auf die quer verlaufende Narbe in der Brustfalte verzichtet werden kann. Dank der Schrumpfungstendenz der elastischen Haut glättet sich die plisséeartig zusammengezogene Raffnaht vollständig in den darauffolgenden Wocheen.\nBeim T-Schnitt ist für die Patientin das Ergebnis nach der Operation sofort erkennbar, bei der narbenarmen Technik muss bis zum Erreichen des endgültigen Resultates mit ca. 2-3 Monaten gerechnet werden."

Dieses kann entweder zwischen Haut und Brustmuskel (subkutan) oder unter den Brustmuskel (submuskulär) gelegt werden. Der Nachteil der subkutanen Platzierung ist die Sicht- und Tastbarkeit des Implantats mit der erhöhten Gefahr einer Kapselfibrose von ca. 25 %.

Verschiedene Methoden stehen zur Auswahl. Reine Hautverschiebelappen vom Oberbauch (abdominal advencement) mit eher unbefriedigenden kosmetischen Resultaten oder an einem Gefäßstiel frei übertragene Hautfettlappen aus der Bauch- bzw. Gesäßregion (DIEP- bzw. S-GAP-flap) können zur Anwendung kommen.\nEs muss jedoch berücksichtigt werden, dass durch eine notwendig gewordene Nachbestrahlung des Gewebes der Brustwand einschließlich der dort verlaufenden Anschlussgefäße starke Verhärtungen mit Minderdurchblutung aufweisen kann. Eine freie Gewebeübertragung mit mikrochirurgischem Gefäßanschluss würde in diesen Fällen ein zu hohes Risiko des gesamten Hautlappenverlustes bergen.\nDie größere Sicherheit bieten die Hautmuskellappen vom Rücken (Latissimus dorsi-flap) bzw. vom Bauch (TRAM-flap). Bei sind sehr gut zur Brustrekonstruktion geeignet und hinterlassen unproblematische, kosmetisch akzeptable Narben in der Entnahmeregion. Der Latissimus dorsi ist ein großer, flacher Rückenmuskel, der in seinem unteren Ansatz losgelöst von einer kleinen Hautinsel zur Brustwand geschwenkt wird. Der obere Gefäßstiel wird dabei nicht durchtrennt, so dass die Blutversorgung dauerhaft gewährleistet ist. Um ein entsprechend großes Brustvolumen zu erreichen, kann ein zusätzliches Brustimplantat unter dem Muskellappen notwendig werden. Bewegungseinschränkungen durch das Fehlen des Muskels am Rücken kommen nicht vor.\nDer TRAM-Bauchhautlappen ist den Patientinnen empfohlen, die z.B. durch Schwangerschaften oder ernährungsbedingt einen Überschuss an Hautfettgewebe im Unterbauchbereich bieten. Durch Herauslösen eines längsverlaufenden Muskelstreifens, der die zuführenden Gefäße für den Bauchlappen enthält, kann ein vergleichsweise großes Hautstück zur Brustwand nach oben geschwenkt und zu einer neuen Brust geformt werden. Ein angenehmer Nebeneffekt dieser Operation ist die Bauchstraffung, die von den Patientinnen im allgemeinen sehr begrüßt wird.\nDurch das somit reichlich zur Verfügung stehende Hautfettgewebe kann bei der Brustrekonstruktion auf ein zusätzliches Implantat verzichtet werden. Bei sehr großer Brust auf der gesunden Gegenseite kann auf Wunsch eine zusätzliche Angleichungsreduktion durchgeführt werden.\nDurch das somit reichlich zur Verfügung stehende Hautfettgewebe kann bei der Brustrekonstruktion auf ein zusätzliches Implantat verzichtet werden. Bei sehr großer Brust auf der gesunden Gegenseite kann auf Wunsch eine zusätzliche Angleichungsreduktion durchgeführt werden.\nZur Rekonstruktion der Brustwarze wird von der gesunden Seite der obere Anteil tangential entnommen und an entsprechender Stelle auf der Gegenseite eingepflanzt. Die Entnahmeregion heilt problemlos ab und der Warzenhof kann durch Tätowierung in der passenden individuellen Hautfarbe und Größe nachgebildet werden. So entstehen keine zusätzlichen Narben oder Gewebsverluste, denn eine Verwendung von Haut aus dem Schambereich oder anderen Regionen ist unseres Erachtens unnötig und bietet kosmetisch keinerlei Vorteile."

        "content": "In vielen Fällen sind selbst durch strenge Diäten, sportliche Aktivitäten und Cellulite-Spezialbehandlungen hartnäckige Fettpolster nicht zu bekämpfen. Hier kommt die Fettabsaugung (Liposuction) zum Einsatz und kann zu hervorragenden, dauerhaften Verbesserungen des Körperbildes führen. Über sehr kurze, kaum sichtbare Hautschnitte werden mit Hilfe von dünnen Saugkanülen und einem apparativ erzeugten Unterdruck überschüssige Fettzellen entfernt. Zuvor wird das Fettgewebe durch Eingabe von einer speziellen blut- und schmerzstillenden Flüssigkeit aufgeschwemmt, wodurch eine Verbesserung des Absaugvorganges erzielt wird. Durch Verwendung von Ultraschallwellen wird hierbei besonders gewebeschonend vorgegangen, so dass Blutergüsse und Schwellungen auf ein Minimum reduziert werden können. Zusätzlich bewirkt die Ultraschallenergie einen biologischen Reiz auf tiefere Hautschichten, die sich bei leichter Erschlaffung und nicht allzu großem Hautüberschuss kräftigen und straffen können. Zur Unterstützung des Heilungsvorganges empfehlen wir das Tragen einer speziellen Miederhose für 6-8 Wochen nach der Operation.\nIn den Händen des erfahrenen Operateurs kann die ultraschall-assistierte Liposuction (UAL) zu beindruckenden Verbesserungen der gesamten Körperkontur führen, die durch keine anderen Methode erreichbar sind. Die Behandlung kann prinzipielle an jeder Körperstelle und in jedem Alter durchgeführt werden, unter der Voraussetzung, dass die haut noch genügend Eigenelastizität besitzt.\nDer Eingriff wird bei kleineren Korrekturen in der Regel ambulant und in örtlicher Betäubung durchgeführt. Hierbei erhält man Infusion mit Schmerzmitteln, so daß Sie die Operation kaum spüren und Sie können die Klinik unmittelbar nach dem Eingriff verlassen.Bei größeren Eingriffen ist eine Vollnarkose erforderlich. Die notwendigen Voruntersuchungen werden nach Terminabsprache in der Klinik durchgeführt. Dabei haben Sie auch Gelegenheit, die Narkose mit dem Anästhesisten zu besprechen. Je nach Eingriff ist mit einem Klinikaufenthalt von 1 bis 3 Tagen zu rechnen."

Bei weniger aufwendigen Behandlungen kann die Povergrößerung auch ambulant unter lokaler Betäubung und in Dämmerschlaf stattfinden. Bevor es losgeht kann die Patientin noch ein ausführliches Gespräch mit ihrem Operateur und dem Narkosearzt führen und ggf. letzte Fragen klären. Dann geht es in den OP.\nIm Rahmen einer Fettabsaugung (Liposuktion) wird zunächst das Fett abgesaugt, welches gebraucht wird, um das Gesäßvolumen zu erhöhen und eine neue Po-Form zu schaffen. Dies erfolgt üblicherweise mittels der Tumeszenztechnik. Dabei wird vor dem Absaugeprozess eine Flüssigkeit in die Spenderareale injiziert, die das Fettgewebe löst und auflockert. Damit ist es möglich, das Fett schonend abzusaugen, ohne das umliegende Gewebe - also Venen, Gefäße und Nerven - zu verletzen. Es wird anschließend für das Lipofilling speziell aufbereitet.\nNun folgt die eigentliche Po-Formung. Mit feinen Kanülen wird das gewonnene Fettgewebe gezielt und gleichmäßig in die Gesäßregion verpflanzt, bis die gewünschte Form und Größe erreicht ist. Die Einstichstellen werden mit einer Mini-Naht verschlossen."

Im Verlauf des Lebens entstehen Falten und Alterungserscheinungen v.a. im Gesicht durch verschiedene Einflussfaktoren, dabei unterscheidet man mimische und altersbedingte Falten. Die mimischen Falten entstehen aufgrund eines Muskelzuges unter der Haut, so entstehen z.B. die Zornesfalte und auch die Nasolabialfalte. Durch einen Dauerzug der Muskulatur über Jahre entstehen somit entsprechende Falten, welche ab einem bestimmten Zeitpunkt sogar fortbestehen, wenn keine Gesichtsmimik durchgeführt wird. Hier kann man z.B. frühzeitig mit Botox entgegenwirken um den Muskelzug zu schwächen und die Faltentiefe zu mildern.\nAltersbedingte Falten hingegen entstehen durch einen Verlust der Elastin- und Kollagenfasern im Unterhautgewebe. Diese produzieren sich im Alter nur verlangsamt neu und erschlaffen mit der Zeit. Weiterhin ist die Qualität der Kollagen- und Elastinfasern nicht mehr so hochwertig und langlebig wie in der Jugend, so dass es auf Dauer zu einem Verlust dieser Fasern kommt.\nAuch äußere Einflussfaktoren wie Sonnenlicht, Hitze und Kälte, Verletzungen, Stress, Rauchen etc. wirken sich negativ auf die Langlebigkeit der Kollagenfasern aus. Die natürliche Hautalterung ist somit nichts anderes als eine Störung eines dynamischen Gleichgewichtes zwischen Abbau und Neuproduktion von Elastin- und Kollagenfasern."

Diese Lokalmaßnahme dient dazu, kleine Fältchen, Verhornungen oder auch oberflächliche Pigmentflecken, wie z.B. die sogenannten Altersflecken, zu entfernen. Diese bewährte Methode ist auch zur Verbesserung des Erscheinungsbildes bei Aknenarben geeignet. Bei fachmännisch ausgeführter Technik kann das medizinische Peeling vor allem das sonnengeschädigte, durch Wind und Wetter vorgealterte Gesicht optisch um Jahre verjüngen.\nJe nach beabsichtigter Hautschältiefe werden verschiedene Substanzen verwendet. Die gebräuchlichsten sind Vitamin A-Säure, Glykolsäure, Trichloressigsäure sowie das besonders stark wirksame Phenol. Die Anwendung der Peelingsubstanzen, insbesondere jedoch von Phenol, sollte nur dem Erfahrenen vorbehalten bleiben, da hier einige Besonderheiten im Vorfeld zu beachten sind. Im Gegensatz zur Dermabrasio, dem Hautabschleifen, deren Ausmaß vom Chirurgen selbst exakt bestimmt werden kann, ist die Eindringtiefe der Peelingsubstanzen von verschiedenen Faktoren abhängig. Dies kann zur Folge haben, dass unbeabsichtigt tiefere Hautschichten in Mitleidenschaft gezogen werden, was eine unerwünschte Narbenbildung zur Folge hätte. Grundsätzlich beginnt die Prozedur mit einer sorgfältigen Reinigung und Entfettung der Haut. Die Applikation der Lösung erfolgt bei der erstmaligen Anwendung stets mit der niedrigsten Konzentration. Der Patient spürt sodann eine rasch einsetzende Wirkung durch leichtes Brennen und Wärmebildung auf der Haut. Nach mehrmaligem Auftragen bildet sich schließlich ein weißlicher Reifbelag. Dieser gewünschte Effekt ist somit erreicht und der Vorgang beendet. In der darauffolgenden Zeit zeigt sich eine Abstoßung der oberflächlichen Hautschichten. Dieses Abschilfern ist nach ca. 12 Wochen abgeschlossen und zurück bleibt eine rosig frische, glatte Haut. Nach jedem Peelingverfahren ist es wichtig, die behandelten Flächen konsequent einzucremen und mit einem hypoallergenen Lichtschutzpräparat zu schützen. Ohne entsprechenden Schutz sind Sonnenbäder nicht vor Ablauf eines halben Jahres erlaubt."

Ist eine Abschleifung zu oberflächlich, so bleibt der gewünschte Effekt der Faltenglättung aus. Wird dagegen zu tief abgeschliffen, reagiert die Haut wie bei jeder anderen tieferen Verletzung mit einer Narbenbildung. Auch hier zeigt sich also, dass dieser ansonsten relativ einfache und risikoarme Eingriff nur vom Erfahrenen durchgeführt werden sollte.\nNach der Dermabrasio bedeckt sich im Allgemeinen die anfängliche Wundfläche innerhalb von 2 Tagen mit einem Wundschorf, der sich nach etwa 8-10 Tagen löst und spontan abstößt. Nach kompletter Abstoßung zeigt sich eine zarte, rosafarbene haut, die anfangs noch äußerst empfindlich ist. Die Nachbehandlung der glatten Haut erscheint auch hier wie beim Peelingverfahren zweckmäßig. Kosmetische Cremes oder Schminke sind frühestens nach 2 Wochen erlaubt, und die bereits erwähnten Hinweise bezüglich der UV-Exposition sind ebenfalls für mindestens ein halbes Jahr zu beachten."

Hierzu wird der ERBIUM-YAG Laser verwendet. Zusätzlich zu seiner präzisen Hautabtragung tritt ein weiterer Effekt auf, das sogenannte „shrinking“. Es kommt dabei neben einer Regeneration der oberen Hautschichten zu einer Neustrukturierung des kollagenen Bindegewebes. Das Resultat ist eine Straffung des gesamten Behandlungsbereiches.\nIn den ersten Tagen nach der Behandlung kommt es wie bei der Dermabrasio ebenfalls zu einer Schorfbildung. Die Ablösung ist nach ca. 5-7 Tagen abgeschlossen, wobei eine spezielle Nachbehandlung mit luftdurchlässigen Maskenfolien empfehlenswert ist. Eine zunächst verbleibende Reströtung klingt im allgemeinen innerhalb von 2-3 Monaten vollständig ab, wobei auch hier zur Vermeidung von Fleckenbildung ein strikter UV-Schutz eingehalten werden muss.

Die Wirkung lässt nach 3-6 Monaten nach und die Falten kommen leider wieder.\n Andere Falten (z.B.

Die Hyaluronsäuren unterscheiden sich je nach Festigkeit auch in Ihrem Wasserbindungsvermögen, so hat eine dünnflüssige Hyaluronsäure weniger Wasserbindungskapazität als eine feste."

Daher können dynamische Falten im Bereich der Stirn und der Zornesfalte aber auch im Bereich der Krähenfüße wunderbar mittels Botulinumtoxin behandelt werden. Durch eine Blockade der neuromuskulären Übertragung werden die für die Falten verantwortlichen Muskeln gelähmt und somit wird der Faltenwurf verhindert. Sicherlich verändert sich dadurch auch geringfügig Ihre Mimik, so können Sie z.B. je nach Anwendungszone nicht mehr die Stirn runzeln, nicht mehr zornig schauen etc.. Die Wirkung lässt nach 3-6 Monaten nach und die Falten kommen leider wieder.\nAndere Falten (z.B. Nasolabialfalten) verstehen sich heute als eine generelle Veränderung im Gesicht, was durch das Herabsacken verschiedener Fettdepots im Wangenbereich geschieht. Hierbei erfolgt das Unterspritzen der Falten multidimensional, das heißt es erfolgt eine Analyse des gesamten Gesichtes um die Ursache von entsprechenden Falten zu finden. Durch unsere Erfahrung können wir Ihnen im Beratungsgespräch unsere Empfehlung gern aussprechen und Sie dementsprechend behandeln."

Hier erhalten Sie umfassende Informationen zur Behandlung und Antworten auf Ihre individuellen Fragen. Das für die Behandlung benötigte Eigenblut gewinnen wir aus einer geeigneten Vene.

Im Regelfall verläuft die PRP-Therapie schmerzarm. Sind Sie schmerzempfindlich und/oder erfolgt der Eingriff an besonders sensiblen Körperpartien, sorgen wir mithilfe eines vorbereitenden Kühlens der Haut oder mit lokal aufzutragenden Betäubungscremes für einen weitgehend schmerzfreien Behandlungsverlauf.\nDas Vampire Lift dauert pro Behandlungseinheit etwa 20 Minuten und ist somit vergleichsweise wenig zeitaufwendig. Je nach gewünschtem Behandlungsumfang und individuellem Ansprechen auf die Maßnahme erstreckt sich ein Vampire Lift über 1 bis 4 aufeinanderfolgende Behandlungseinheiten im Abstand von jeweils 3 bis 4 Wochen.\nHäufig zeigen sich die optischen Behandlungserfolge bereits wenige Tage nach dem Vampire Lift.

Aus Ihrem Blut werden körpereigene Wachstumsfaktoren gewonnen. Diese werden anschließend durch Injektionen, wie bei einer Mesotherapie in die Haut eingebracht. Die konzentrierten Blutplättchen setzen Wachstumsfaktoren frei, die den Prozess der Regeneration der Haut steuern.\nDas Vampire Lift (auch als PRP-Therapie bzw. Platelet-Rich-Plasma-Therapie bezeichnet) ist ein junges Verfahren zur schonenden Hautverjüngung im Gesicht, am Hals und Dekolleté. Die Behandlungsmethode wurde in den USA entwickelt und fand hier besonders bei prominenten Schauspielerinnen und Sängerinnen raschen Anklang. Als „Vampire Lift“ wird das Verfahren bezeichnet, weil dem Patienten im Behandlungsvorfeld eine geringe Menge (ca. 20 ml) an Eigenblut entnommen wird. Aus diesem Eigenblut gewinnen wir blutplättchenreiches Plasma („Platelet-Rich-Plasma“), das in die zu regenerierenden Hautareale injiziert wird. Das Blutplasma sorgt dank enthaltener Wachstumsfaktoren nicht nur für eine Gewebsregeneration sondern fördert auch die Bildung neuer Zellen.\nBei einer Entscheidung für das Vampire Lift müssen Sie mit keinerlei Nebenwirkungen rechnen. Denn für die Behandlung kommt ausschließlich körpereigenes Füllmaterial (Blutplasma) zum Einsatz. Allergien und Unverträglichkeitsreaktionen können somit annähernd ausgeschlossen werden. Unangenehme Nachwirkungen der Behandlung können sich maximal durch leichte Schwellungen in den Injektionsbereichen ausdrücken. Entsprechende Symptome bilden sich aber innerhalb weniger Tage selbstständig wieder zurück. Da das Vampire Lift keine Hautschnitte erfordert, hinterlässt das Verfahren keinerlei Narbengewebe. Die im Blutplasma enthaltenen Wachstumsfaktoren sorgen für einen nachhaltigen Behandlungserfolg. Im Behandlungsanschluss müssen Sie keine Ausfallzeiten einplanen.",

Hierzu zählt vor allem, dass das bei der Behandlung verwendete Blutkonzentrat aus Ihrem eigenen Blut hergestellt wird. Aus diesem Grund ist die Ausführung sehr risikoarm. Denn es ist beinahe unmöglich, dass Unverträglichkeiten oder allergische Reaktionen durch die PRP-Therapie auftreten. Da Eigenblut in der Regel sehr gut verträglich ist, gibt es keine Nebenwirkungen. Die PRP-Therapie ist eine sanfte Behandlung, die ohne einen operativen Eingriff möglich ist. Mit dieser Methode kann ein langfristiger Behandlungseffekt gegen Haarausfall erzielt werden."

Der erzielte Therapieeffekt sollte ggf. mit einer Einzelbehandlung jährlich aufgefrischt werden. In mehr als 90% der Fälle mit akutem Haarausfall, kommt es bereits nach den ersten PRP Behandlungen zur Besserung des Haarverlustes. Keine andere Therapie kann gegenwärtig derart erfolgreiche Ergebnisse erzielen."

Dieses Verfahren ist eine nichtoperative Behandlung, die insbesondere bei lokalen Fettpolstern eingesetzt wird. Bereits seit 1995 wird die Injektionslipolyse weltweit durchgeführt - sie ist also bestens bewährt und basiert auf jahrelangen Erfahrungen.\nBesonders geeignet ist die Behandlung mit der Fett-weg-Spritze bei einzelnen Fettpölsterchen, die sich durch Diät oder sportliche Betätigung nicht reduzieren lassen. Typische Anwendungsbereiche sind am Bauch, Hüften und an den Beinen, am Doppelkinn sowie an der männlichen Brust. Im Vergleich zur Liposuktion, bei der Fettzellen in einen operativen Eingriff abgesaugt werden, stellt die Intralipotherapie einen kleineren und schonenderen Eingriff dar. Die Behandlung ist allerdings auf kleinere Areale begrenzt."

Die Fettzellen werden vollständig abgebaut, folglich ist die Wirkung dauerhaft.\nDie ambulant durchgeführte Behandlung selbst dauert etwa 15 bis 45 Minuten. Zunächst markiert der Arzt den geplanten Behandlungsbereich auf dem Körper des Patienten und desinfiziert anschließend das Areal sorgfältig. Eine Vollnarkose ist nicht notwendig. Bei Bedarf erhalten Sie eine örtliche Betäubung in Form einer Betäubungscreme an den betroffenen Körperstellen, sodass Sie die Einstiche nicht spüren.\nNach der Behandlung kann es rund um die Einstichstelle der Spritze zu Rötungen und Schwellungen kommen. Manche Patienten berichten von Juckreiz oder einer Druckempfindlichkeit an dieser Stelle. Diese Beschwerden klingen jedoch meistens innerhalb von 2 bis 7 Tagen wieder ab. In den meisten Fällen können Sie schon am nächsten Tag wieder arbeiten. Im Rahmen der Nachsorge sollte jedoch 3 Tage lang auf Schwimmbad, Solarium, Sauna und Massagen verzichtet werden."

Die aufgelösten Fette gelangen dann über die Lymphe in den Blutkreislauf, werden dort abtransportiert und über den Stuhl ausgeschieden."

Der Abbau der Fettzellen in der Problemzone wird stimuliert und der Körper entschlackt sich von selbst. Daher sollten Sie nach der Behandlung viel trinken, das erleichtert das Ausschwemmen der unerwünschten Stoffe. Alkohol behindert den Abbau und ist absolut untersagt."
