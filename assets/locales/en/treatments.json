        "content": "The natural ageing process inevitably leads to reduced skin elasticity—with various intensity of wrinkling.\nThe facelift is certainly the most invasive but also the most effective method of achieving visual rejuvenation by rejuvenating the entire face or neck region. The anatomical characteristics that determine our facial expression require special surgical techniques. Essentially, the procedure involves shifting skin flaps with incisions in the hairline area and around the ear. The so-called large face-lift includes a tightening of all structures, i.e. skin and superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS). The SMAS consists of a layer of degenerated muscles with connective tissue and extends from the temples to the neck."

        "content": "An effective facelift procedure starts with detaching the skin of the temple area, cheeks, and the lateral neck region from the underlying SMAS (superficial musculoaponeurotic system) layer while avoiding injury to the facial nerves. Then, the skin is brought under slight tension to the side above and sutured, after removing the excess. Meanwhile, the SMAS  is fixed to support the tightening. Volume adjustments can additionally be made using the patient's fat in the face, e.g. to slightly emphasise the cheekbone region (cheek augmentation). With this kind of double-layer lift, the durability of ten to fifteen years can be achieved.\nWhen weighing up the surgical procedure, between the mini-lift (also called S-lift) and the large lift, the age of the patient should, of course, be taken into consideration.\nIn my experience, younger patients only need a skin tightening, as there is generally no slackening of tissue or muscles. Through a well-positioned incision, the scars can remain invisible. The effect of such procedure only lasts for about 4-5 years, since the deep-lying supporting tissue remains untouched. Despite the critical discussion, the mini-lift is used very often because this technique is more comfortable for the patient and the recovery phase is considerably shorter.\nThe lower cheek and the neck areas are the parts of the face, which are particularly critical for women in their mid-forties and older. Thus, as part of the big lift, the neck is usually tightened in combination with the cheeks. It may also make sense to perform an isolated neck lift. For instances when patients complain of loose skin on the neck, hanging necks, or turkey necks. The supporting tissue can be tightened from a small incision below the chin, if necessary in combination with liposuction. For this procedure, the skin should still have enough elasticity to adapt to the neck without wrinkling after liposuction.\nThe large facelift is often combined with a forehead lift if the forehead and eyebrow area also need to be lifted. The classic forehead lift is performed through a coronary incision in a bow-shaped incision from ear to ear in the hairy area of the head. During this procedure, the skin in the entire forehead area, possibly up to the eyebrow line, is mobilised, tightened and the excess skin is removed. After the forehead lift, a fine, barely visible scar remains behind the hairline. In the case of a conspicuously high forehead, a pre hairline cut can be used since the other incision techniques would result in a higher forehead. The disadvantage of this procedure is a possibly visible scar directly in front of the hairline.\nMuch more elegant, however, a forehead lift can be performed using the most modern techniques based on endoscopy. This minimally invasive technique has dramatically changed the plastic surgery approach over the last decade. Using newly developed devices and special instruments, our procedures can be performed safely and effectively with only minimal incisions and scars. A maximum of three to five mini incisions is made in the hairy scalp through which a tiny video camera and the endoscopic tube for the special instruments are inserted to detach and move the forehead skin. In this way, the forehead, temples and eyebrows can be lifted, transverse and longitudinal wrinkles on the forehead as well as smaller wrinkles in the eye area can be smoothed. The new position of the forehead is fixed with two small short screws in the outer skull bone, which are painlessly removed after about a week. The current surgical results are impressive and certainly, promise further applications in the future."

However, the hair will grow back over the next few months.\nBlood circulation disorders of the skin as a result of excessive nicotine consumption can lead to wound edge necrosis and conspicuous scars. That may require follow-up treatment. If bacterial infections appear, this can lead to wider scars due to delayed, secondary healing of the wound. That can be corrected by another minor operation. Damage to the facial nerves, which is almost impossible in expert hands, generally regenerates within 3 to 6 months. Occasionally, lesions of skin and muscle nerves may occur, but these regenerate on their own within weeks to months.

A harmonious-looking, aesthetic eye area is achieved through the interaction of many individual components. The shape and texture of the eyelids, eyelashes and eyebrows play a decisive role. Unfortunately, age-related changes in the face manifest themselves most clearly in this area.\nThe general \"downward trend\" is decisive for the impression of age, whereby not only a drooping, sagging upper eyelid, but also drooping eyelids or bags under the eyes make the eyes appear small and powerless, even if the mood is actually positive. With a cosmetic surgical intervention in this area, this impairing sagging of the skin can be removed relatively quickly and successfully."

In principle, eyelid lifting should only be carried out by an experienced surgeon, as subsequent corrections, for example in the case of ectropion formation (blepharoplasty), can lead to various complications. There are a number of possible surgical techniques available, whereby the choice of procedure depends on individual circumstances, the amount of skin and fatty tissue to be removed and, last but not least, the age of the patient. Depending on the procedure the surgery can be performed under local or general anaesthesia.\nThe remaining scar is no longer visible after healing, as it lies exactly in the crease of the upper eyelid that appears when the eye is open, and on the lower eyelid it runs directly along the lash line.\nAnother option for lower eyelid lifting is transconjunctival blepharoplasty. This elegant method has the advantage that no external skin incision is necessary if there is little excess skin and fat. The method via the conjunctiva is mainly favoured by younger patients, as only small amounts of fat usually have to be removed here."

In most cases, however, the patient, relatives and friends will hardly remember the original shape of the nose after a few weeks. Aesthetic correction of the nose is one of the most common procedures performed by plastic surgeons. The patient's ideas are always taken into account, and my experience in terms of type, shape, contour and what is technically possible is also taken into account. Together with you, the whole face and the whole profile must always be included in the operation plan. For example, a small nose can look too big - relatively speaking - because of a small chin. Balance can only be achieved here by simultaneously enlarging the chin. In cases where, in addition to a chin that is too small, there is also a misalignment of the jaw or teeth, consultation with an oral surgeon is referred to prior to rhinoplasty.

A crooked nose can be caused by displacement of the bone parts. In some patients, a second minor corrective operation to compensate for the internal scarring may be necessary after six months at the earliest.

This operation can also be performed later in life without any problems. Through a concealed incision behind the ear, the malformed cartilage at the edge of the ear is worked on in such a way that it can be fixed in the desired shape and the protruding ear can easily be placed in a natural position. To aid the healing process, a headband should be worn over the ears, especially at night, for 8 weeks."

A haematoma can be punctured in most cases and only requires a second operation in exceptional cases. A temporary disturbance of the sensation of touch is normal and disappears by itself after some time. Very rarely, if the patient has a predisposition, a scar proliferation develops in the scar, a so-called keloid, which presents itself as a thick, bulging, discoloured, painful and itchy scar. Cortisone injections, pressure bandages and later surgical removal help here, but this is associated with the risk of the keloid recurring. In rare cases, infection of the wound or the ear cartilage can occur, which delays healing. Very rare is damage to the skin or cartilage due to disruption of the blood supply. The risk is increased if previous procedures have been performed on the outer ear. Usually, these areas heal spontaneously. Surgical coverage of the defect is rarely necessary. All surgical procedures require the severing of fine skin nerves, which can lead to reduced sensation or insensitivity, especially to cold. This slowly recedes over several months but can be persistent in individual cases. In the rare case of intolerance of the suture material, the suture is rejected, causing the auricle to protrude again. The cosmetic results after auricular correction are usually good. No two ears are alike, either before or after the operation. For example, one ear may be larger than the other and protrude further. The cartilage structure may also be different from the other. Even after the operation, the result can still change due to scarring or the restoring forces of the cartilage, so that a deformation of the auricle can occur again. A second surgical procedure can correct the results again in such cases."

With the textured implant surface, the risk of capsule formation with sometimes painful hardening of the breast is significantly reduced. There is currently a choice of filling substances such as saline solution and silicone gel. Soya oil, which was offered in the past, was withdrawn from the market in 1999 because of undesirable side effects. The hydrogel was also withdrawn in Great Britain in December 2000 due to a lack of long-term studies that could prove its safe use.\nWhich implant is ultimately used should be decided by the attending physician in consultation with the patient. We recommend only cross-linked silicone gel-filled prostheses to our patients and use only the highest quality and safest brand products. Due to an outstanding variety of advantages, such as pleasant, soft consistency, thorough medical research and excellent stability, these products have proven their worth over decades. The discussions in the media about the harmfulness of silicone or the implants bursting when diving or in an aeroplane are finally a thing of the past. Silicon as a component of silicone is the second most common element on earth and one of the most intensively researched materials in medicine. It has undergone extensive safety testing and is also widely used in the pharmaceutical and food processing industries in a harmless way.\nAlternatives such as saline or hydrogel are more fluid than silicone gel and therefore inelastic with unsatisfactory tactile sensation or continuous for the implant shell, so that, unlike silicone gel, there can be undesirable volume fluctuations.\nIn 2017, a rare form of lymphoma, Breast Implant-Associated Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (BIA-ALCL), caused by textured implants was reported. Due to this observation, the macrotextured implants were withdrawn from the market. \nDifferent shapes are used. There are round, transverse oval teardrop and anatomically shaped implants that are implanted either above or below the pectoral muscle. Access can be from a small incision in the breast fold, axillary or at the areola.\nThe procedure for the best result depends on the given breast shape, the thickness of the breast gland tissue and, last but not least, the individual wishes of the patient. To achieve an optimal breast shape, an additional breast lift may occasionally be necessary."

Depending on your disposition, this capsule can harden (Capsular Fibrosis), making the breast feel firmer than normal. Such hardening can vary in severity and, in the worst cases, can lead to pain, displacement of the implant or deformation of the breast. In rare cases (about 5%), a new operation is necessary to widen the implant site or replace the implant.\nLike all plastics, silicone pads are subject to certain material fatigue, which can lead to defects in the covering. Moreover, the implants can also be injured and burst as a result of breast trauma, e.g. due to serious accidents. The double-walled covering offers a high degree of protection in this case, but it can still happen that filling material leaks into the surrounding tissue. In the case of implants with saline filling, this is completely harmless, as saline is completely absorbed by the body within a few hours. With other filling materials, so-called siliconomas can develop after months or years due to tissue reactions.\nDepending on the position of the skin incision, the feeling at the nipple can be temporarily impaired, especially with large implants. In exceptional cases, wound healing problems, haematomas, infections and seroma formations can occur, which can lead to the implant having to be temporarily removed.\nIf you are a woman of an age where you have regular mammography examinations, you should always inform your doctor about your breast implant, as it can affect the examination results.\nPostoperative bleeding is extremely rare but may still occur 1 to 2 days after surgery."

In most cases, a simultaneous correction of the position and size of the areola is necessary.\nBy preserving the blood vessels and nerves at the nipple, the sensation, as well as the ability to breastfeed, is generally not restricted. The scar pattern in the classic standard method is also called an anchor-shaped or inverted T incision with a vertical scar and a transverse scar in the breast fold.\nDepending on the size of the breast and the elasticity of the skin, a minor-scar technique (according to Lejour) with a vertical gathering suture can also be used, in which the transverse scar in the breast fold can be dispensed with. Thanks to the shrinking tendency of the elastic skin, the pleated gathered suture is completely smoothed out in the following weeks.\nWith the T-incision, the patient can see the result immediately after the operation, with the minor-scar technique it takes about 2-3 months to achieve the final result."

This can be placed either between the skin and the pectoral muscle (subcutaneous) or under the pectoral muscle (submuscular). The disadvantage of subcutaneous placement is the visibility and palpability of the implant with the increased risk of capsular fibrosis of about 25%. The submuscular position therefore offers better soft tissue coverage of the implant with a significantly lower rate of capsular fibrosis of less than 10%, but can comparatively lead to an undesirable rounder shape."

Various methods are available. Pure skin flaps from the upper abdomen (abdominal advancement) with rather unsatisfactory cosmetic results or skin fat flaps from the abdominal or buttock region (DIEP or S-GAP flap) freely transferred on a vascular pedicle can be used.\nHowever, it must be taken into account that the tissue of the chest wall, including the connecting vessels running there, may show severe hardening with reduced blood circulation due to any necessary post-radiation. In these cases, a free tissue transfer with microsurgical vessel connection would involve too high a risk of total skin flap loss.\nThe skin muscle flaps from the back (latissimus dorsi-flap) or from the abdomen (TRAM-flap) offer greater safety. They are very suitable for breast reconstruction and leave unproblematic, cosmetically acceptable scars in the area of removal. The latissimus dorsi is a large, flat muscle of the back, which in its lower attachment is detached from a small island of skin and pivoted towards the chest wall. The upper vascular pedicle is not severed in the process, so that the blood supply is permanently guaranteed. In order to achieve a correspondingly large breast volume, an additional breast implant may be necessary under the muscle flap. Movement restrictions due to the absence of the muscle on the back do not occur.\nThe TRAM abdominal skin flap is recommended for patients who offer an excess of skin fat tissue in the lower abdominal area, e.g. due to pregnancy or dietary reasons. By detaching a longitudinal strip of muscle that contains the feeding vessels for the abdominal flap, a comparatively large piece of skin can be swung up towards the chest wall and formed into a new breast. A pleasant side effect of this operation is the tummy tuck, which is generally very welcomed by patients.\nThanks to the thus abundant skin fat tissue available, an additional implant can be dispensed with in breast reconstruction. In the case of very large breasts on the healthy opposite side, an additional approximation reduction can be carried out if desired.\nThanks to the thus abundant available skin fat tissue, an additional implant can be dispensed with in breast reconstruction. In the case of very large breasts on the healthy opposite side, an additional approximation reduction can be carried out if desired.\nFor the reconstruction of the nipple, the upper part is removed tangentially from the healthy side and implanted in the appropriate place on the opposite side. The region of removal heals without any problems and the areola can be reconstructed by tattooing in the appropriate individual skin colour and size. This way, there are no additional scars or tissue losses, because in our opinion, using skin from the pubic area or other regions is unnecessary and offers no cosmetic advantages."

Hier kommt die Fettabsaugung (Liposuction) zum Einsatz und kann zu hervorragenden, dauerhaften Verbesserungen des Körperbildes führen. Über sehr kurze, kaum sichtbare Hautschnitte werden mit Hilfe von dünnen Saugkanülen und einem apparativ erzeugten Unterdruck überschüssige Fettzellen entfernt. Zuvor wird das Fettgewebe durch Eingabe von einer speziellen blut- und schmerzstillenden Flüssigkeit aufgeschwemmt, wodurch eine Verbesserung des Absaugvorganges erzielt wird. Durch Verwendung von Ultraschallwellen wird hierbei besonders gewebeschonend vorgegangen, so dass Blutergüsse und Schwellungen auf ein Minimum reduziert werden können. Zusätzlich bewirkt die Ultraschallenergie einen biologischen Reiz auf tiefere Hautschichten, die sich bei leichter Erschlaffung und nicht allzu großem Hautüberschuss kräftigen und straffen können. Zur Unterstützung des Heilungsvorganges empfehlen wir das Tragen einer speziellen Miederhose für 6-8 Wochen nach der Operation.\nIn den Händen des erfahrenen Operateurs kann die ultraschall-assistierte Liposuction (UAL) zu beindruckenden Verbesserungen der gesamten Körperkontur führen, die durch keine anderen Methode erreichbar sind. Die Behandlung kann prinzipielle an jeder Körperstelle und in jedem Alter durchgeführt werden, unter der Voraussetzung, dass die haut noch genügend Eigenelastizität besitzt.\nDer Eingriff wird bei kleineren Korrekturen in der Regel ambulant und in örtlicher Betäubung durchgeführt.

Und wie in allen anderen Bereichen der Schönheitschirurgie soll auch die Po-Vergrößerung am besten schonend und ohne komplizierte Schnitte funktionieren. Eine Eigenfettunterspritzung zur Konturierung und Vergrößerung des Gesäßes, gilt derzeit als die effektivste und komplikationsärmste Methode im Bereich der Poformung."

        "content": "Ein Brazilian Butt Lift ist eine zweiteilige Behandlung, die insgesamt bis zu vier Stunden dauern kann - je nach Umfang des Eingriffs bzw. der Absaugemenge des Eigenfetts erhöht sich die OP-Dauer. Vorzugsweise wird das Brazilian Butt Lift unter Vollnarkose durchgeführt. Bei weniger aufwendigen Behandlungen kann die Povergrößerung auch ambulant unter lokaler Betäubung und in Dämmerschlaf stattfinden. Bevor es losgeht kann die Patientin noch ein ausführliches Gespräch mit ihrem Operateur und dem Narkosearzt führen und ggf. letzte Fragen klären. Dann geht es in den OP.\nIm Rahmen einer Fettabsaugung (Liposuktion) wird zunächst das Fett abgesaugt, welches gebraucht wird, um das Gesäßvolumen zu erhöhen und eine neue Po-Form zu schaffen. Dies erfolgt üblicherweise mittels der Tumeszenztechnik. Dabei wird vor dem Absaugeprozess eine Flüssigkeit in die Spenderareale injiziert, die das Fettgewebe löst und auflockert. Damit ist es möglich, das Fett schonend abzusaugen, ohne das umliegende Gewebe - also Venen, Gefäße und Nerven - zu verletzen. Es wird anschließend für das Lipofilling speziell aufbereitet.\nNun folgt die eigentliche Po-Formung. Mit feinen Kanülen wird das gewonnene Fettgewebe gezielt und gleichmäßig in die Gesäßregion verpflanzt, bis die gewünschte Form und Größe erreicht ist. Die Einstichstellen werden mit einer Mini-Naht verschlossen."

        "content": "Dem genetischen Alterungsprozess entgeht leider niemand. Im Verlauf des Lebens entstehen Falten und Alterungserscheinungen v.a. im Gesicht durch verschiedene Einflussfaktoren, dabei unterscheidet man mimische und altersbedingte Falten. Die mimischen Falten entstehen aufgrund eines Muskelzuges unter der Haut, so entstehen z.B. die Zornesfalte und auch die Nasolabialfalte. Durch einen Dauerzug der Muskulatur über Jahre entstehen somit entsprechende Falten, welche ab einem bestimmten Zeitpunkt sogar fortbestehen, wenn keine Gesichtsmimik durchgeführt wird. Hier kann man z.B. frühzeitig mit Botox entgegenwirken um den Muskelzug zu schwächen und die Faltentiefe zu mildern.\nAltersbedingte Falten hingegen entstehen durch einen Verlust der Elastin- und Kollagenfasern im Unterhautgewebe. Diese produzieren sich im Alter nur verlangsamt neu und erschlaffen mit der Zeit. Weiterhin ist die Qualität der Kollagen- und Elastinfasern nicht mehr so hochwertig und langlebig wie in der Jugend, so dass es auf Dauer zu einem Verlust dieser Fasern kommt.\nAuch äußere Einflussfaktoren wie Sonnenlicht, Hitze und Kälte, Verletzungen, Stress, Rauchen etc. wirken sich negativ auf die Langlebigkeit der Kollagenfasern aus. Die natürliche Hautalterung ist somit nichts anderes als eine Störung eines dynamischen Gleichgewichtes zwischen Abbau und Neuproduktion von Elastin- und Kollagenfasern."

Diese Lokalmaßnahme dient dazu, kleine Fältchen, Verhornungen oder auch oberflächliche Pigmentflecken, wie z.B. die sogenannten Altersflecken, zu entfernen. Diese bewährte Methode ist auch zur Verbesserung des Erscheinungsbildes bei Aknenarben geeignet. Bei fachmännisch ausgeführter Technik kann das medizinische Peeling vor allem das sonnengeschädigte, durch Wind und Wetter vorgealterte Gesicht optisch um Jahre verjüngen.\nJe nach beabsichtigter Hautschältiefe werden verschiedene Substanzen verwendet. Die gebräuchlichsten sind Vitamin A-Säure, Glykolsäure, Trichloressigsäure sowie das besonders stark wirksame Phenol. Die Anwendung der Peelingsubstanzen, insbesondere jedoch von Phenol, sollte nur dem Erfahrenen vorbehalten bleiben, da hier einige Besonderheiten im Vorfeld zu beachten sind. Im Gegensatz zur Dermabrasio, dem Hautabschleifen, deren Ausmaß vom Chirurgen selbst exakt bestimmt werden kann, ist die Eindringtiefe der Peelingsubstanzen von verschiedenen Faktoren abhängig. Dies kann zur Folge haben, dass unbeabsichtigt tiefere Hautschichten in Mitleidenschaft gezogen werden, was eine unerwünschte Narbenbildung zur Folge hätte. Grundsätzlich beginnt die Prozedur mit einer sorgfältigen Reinigung und Entfettung der Haut. Die Applikation der Lösung erfolgt bei der erstmaligen Anwendung stets mit der niedrigsten Konzentration. Der Patient spürt sodann eine rasch einsetzende Wirkung durch leichtes Brennen und Wärmebildung auf der Haut. Nach mehrmaligem Auftragen bildet sich schließlich ein weißlicher Reifbelag. Dieser gewünschte Effekt ist somit erreicht und der Vorgang beendet. In der darauffolgenden Zeit zeigt sich eine Abstoßung der oberflächlichen Hautschichten. Dieses Abschilfern ist nach ca. 12 Wochen abgeschlossen und zurück bleibt eine rosig frische, glatte Haut. Nach jedem Peelingverfahren ist es wichtig, die behandelten Flächen konsequent einzucremen und mit einem hypoallergenen Lichtschutzpräparat zu schützen. Ohne entsprechenden Schutz sind Sonnenbäder nicht vor Ablauf eines halben Jahres erlaubt."

Bei diesem hochtourigen Abschleifen mit diamantbeschichteten Schleifköpfen ist es wichtig, die Haut möglichst gleichmäßig abzutragen, damit sich eine glatte, neue Oberfläche bilden kann. Ist eine Abschleifung zu oberflächlich, so bleibt der gewünschte Effekt der Faltenglättung aus. Wird dagegen zu tief abgeschliffen, reagiert die Haut wie bei jeder anderen tieferen Verletzung mit einer Narbenbildung. Auch hier zeigt sich also, dass dieser ansonsten relativ einfache und risikoarme Eingriff nur vom Erfahrenen durchgeführt werden sollte.\nNach der Dermabrasio bedeckt sich im Allgemeinen die anfängliche Wundfläche innerhalb von 2 Tagen mit einem Wundschorf, der sich nach etwa 8-10 Tagen löst und spontan abstößt. Nach kompletter Abstoßung zeigt sich eine zarte, rosafarbene haut, die anfangs noch äußerst empfindlich ist. Die Nachbehandlung der glatten Haut erscheint auch hier wie beim Peelingverfahren zweckmäßig. Kosmetische Cremes oder Schminke sind frühestens nach 2 Wochen erlaubt, und die bereits erwähnten Hinweise bezüglich der UV-Exposition sind ebenfalls für mindestens ein halbes Jahr zu beachten."

Hierzu wird der ERBIUM-YAG Laser verwendet. Zusätzlich zu seiner präzisen Hautabtragung tritt ein weiterer Effekt auf, das sogenannte „shrinking“. Es kommt dabei neben einer Regeneration der oberen Hautschichten zu einer Neustrukturierung des kollagenen Bindegewebes. Das Resultat ist eine Straffung des gesamten Behandlungsbereiches.\nIn den ersten Tagen nach der Behandlung kommt es wie bei der Dermabrasio ebenfalls zu einer Schorfbildung. Die Ablösung ist nach ca. 5-7 Tagen abgeschlossen, wobei eine spezielle Nachbehandlung mit luftdurchlässigen Maskenfolien empfehlenswert ist. Eine zunächst verbleibende Reströtung klingt im allgemeinen innerhalb von 2-3 Monaten vollständig ab, wobei auch hier zur Vermeidung von Fleckenbildung ein strikter UV-Schutz eingehalten werden muss. Sollte nach etwa 3-5 Jahren eine erneute Behandlung erforderlich sein, ist diese problemlos möglich."

Die Hyaluronsäuren unterscheiden sich je nach Festigkeit auch in Ihrem Wasserbindungsvermögen, so hat eine dünnflüssige Hyaluronsäure weniger Wasserbindungskapazität als eine feste.\nEine weitere Möglichkeit besteht in der Anwendung von Eigenfett. Hier wird in einer Operation (in Vollnarkose oder Lokalanästhesie) Ihr Fett aus entsprechenden Depots gewonnen, speziell und aufwendig aufgearbeitet und im Anschluss in Ihr Gesicht etc. gespritzt. Eigenfett hat nicht nur volumengebende Eigenschaften sondern wirkt auch hauterfrischend bzw. verjüngend durch enthaltene Stammzellen und Wachstumsfaktoren. Leider wachsen ca. 20-30% der transplantierten Stammzellen im Durchschnitt nicht an, so dass der Eingriff ggf. wiederholt werden muss.

Die Behandlungsmethode wurde in den USA entwickelt und fand hier besonders bei prominenten Schauspielerinnen und Sängerinnen raschen Anklang. Als „Vampire Lift“ wird das Verfahren bezeichnet, weil dem Patienten im Behandlungsvorfeld eine geringe Menge (ca. 20 ml) an Eigenblut entnommen wird. Aus diesem Eigenblut gewinnen wir blutplättchenreiches Plasma („Platelet-Rich-Plasma“), das in die zu regenerierenden Hautareale injiziert wird. Das blutplättchenreiche Plasma sorgt dank der enthaltenden Wachstumsfaktoren nicht nur für eine Geweberegeneration sondern fördert auch die Bildung neuer Zellen.\nBei einer Entscheidung für das Vampire Lift müssen Sie mit keinerlei Nebenwirkungen rechnen. Denn für die Behandlung kommt ausschließlich körpereigenes Füllmaterial (Blutplasma) zum Einsatz. Allergien und Unverträglichkeitsreaktionen können somit annähernd ausgeschlossen werden. Unangenehme Nachwirkungen der Behandlung können sich maximal durch leichte Schwellungen in den Injektionsbereichen ausdrücken. Entsprechende Symptome bilden sich aber innerhalb weniger Tage selbstständig wieder zurück. Da das Vampire Lift keine Hautschnitte erfordert, hinterlässt das Verfahren keinerlei Narbengewebe.

        "title": "Allgemeines zur Fett-Weg-Spritze",
        "content": "Die sogenannte Injektionslipolyse ist die kontrollierte Zerstörung von Fettzellen mittels medizinischer Substanzen. Dieses Verfahren ist eine nichtoperative Behandlung, die insbesondere bei lokalen Fettpolstern eingesetzt wird. Bereits seit 1995 wird die Injektionslipolyse weltweit durchgeführt - sie ist also bestens bewährt und basiert auf jahrelangen Erfahrungen.\nBesonders geeignet ist die Behandlung mit der Fett-weg-Spritze bei einzelnen Fettpölsterchen, die sich durch Diät oder sportliche Betätigung nicht reduzieren lassen. Typische Anwendungsbereiche sind am Bauch, Hüften und an den Beinen, am Doppelkinn sowie an der männlichen Brust. Im Vergleich zur Liposuktion, bei der Fettzellen in einen operativen Eingriff abgesaugt werden, stellt die Intralipotherapie einen kleineren und schonenderen Eingriff dar. Die Behandlung ist allerdings auf kleinere Areale begrenzt."

        "title": "Die Behandlung",
        "content": "Die Behandlung verläuft nahezu schmerzfrei. Es sind meist mehrere Sitzungen im Abstand von ca. 4 bis 6 Wochen notwendig, die Anzahl der Sitzungen hängt vom Fettdepot ab. Die Fettzellen werden vollständig abgebaut, folglich ist die Wirkung dauerhaft.\nDie ambulant durchgeführte Behandlung selbst dauert etwa 15 bis 45 Minuten. Zunächst markiert der Arzt den geplanten Behandlungsbereich auf dem Körper des Patienten und desinfiziert anschließend das Areal sorgfältig. Eine Vollnarkose ist nicht notwendig. Bei Bedarf erhalten Sie eine örtliche Betäubung in Form einer Betäubungscreme an den betroffenen Körperstellen, sodass Sie die Einstiche nicht spüren.\nNach der Behandlung kann es rund um die Einstichstelle der Spritze zu Rötungen und Schwellungen kommen. Manche Patienten berichten von Juckreiz oder einer Druckempfindlichkeit an dieser Stelle. Diese Beschwerden klingen jedoch meistens innerhalb von 2 bis 7 Tagen wieder ab. In den meisten Fällen können Sie schon am nächsten Tag wieder arbeiten. Im Rahmen der Nachsorge sollte jedoch 3 Tage lang auf Schwimmbad, Solarium, Sauna und Massagen verzichtet werden."

            "subtitle": "Es gibt unterschiedliche Präparate, die zur Injektionslipolyse eingesetzt werden. Gemeinsamer Wirkstoff aller Produkte sind Gallensäure-Salze in unterschiedlicher Aufbereitung. Weiterer Wirkstoff einiger Präparate ist Phosphatidylcholin (Lecithin aus der Sojabohne).\nDie Wirkung der Fett-Weg-Spritze basiert auf dem Prinzip der Lipolyse, so heißt der biochemische Prozess der Fettauflösung in den Körperzellen, der zunächst beginnt, die Fetthülle aufzuweichen. Die aufgelösten Fette gelangen dann über die Lymphe in den Blutkreislauf, werden dort abtransportiert und über den Stuhl ausgeschieden."

So sind alle Nebenwirkungen allgemein bekannt - diese begrenzen sich auf eine minimale Schwellung, Rötung, Überwärmung im Injektionsbereich und gesteigerte Druckempfindlichkeit für wenige Tage sowie ggf. blaue Flecken, die jedoch schnell verschwinden."

          {
            "title": "Ist das Ergebnis mit der Fett-weg-Spritze dauerhaft?",
            "subtitle": "Ja, denn das Fett und die Fettzellen lösen sich auf und werden über das Lymphsystem abtransportiert, in der Leber abgebaut und verstoffwechselt. Jedoch besitzt der menschliche Körper ausreichend Fettzellen überall am Körper, so dass bei übermäßigen Essen und zu wenig Bewegung, die Fettdepots durchaus wieder an der behandelten Stelle entstehen können."

            "title": "Was sollte ich nach der Behandlung mit der Fettweg-Spritze beachten?",
            "subtitle": "In der Zeit nach der Behandlung sollten Sie möglichst bequeme Bekleidung tragen.\nAuf Sauna und stärkere sportliche Betätigung sollte man für mehrere Tage verzichten, Sonne sowie Solarium sind ebenso verboten. Der Abbau der Fettzellen in der Problemzone wird stimuliert und der Körper entschlackt sich von selbst. Daher sollten Sie nach der Behandlung viel trinken, das erleichtert das Ausschwemmen der unerwünschten Stoffe. Alkohol behindert den Abbau und ist absolut untersagt."
